            <strong><p>In "The Poet," Jack McEvoy, a crime-beat reporter, gets hit with heavy news – his twin bro, Sean, a Denver detective, supposedly checked out by suicide. But Jack's not buying it – it just doesn't add up. He's set on digging deeper, convinced there's more to his brother's dark exit than meets the eye. It's a gritty, twisty tale with a reporter on a mission for the truth.</p></strong>
