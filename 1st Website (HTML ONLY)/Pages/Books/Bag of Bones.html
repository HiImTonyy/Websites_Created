            <strong><p>In "Bag of Bones," Stephen King takes you to his spooky Maine setting. It's about this 40-year-old hotshot author, Mike Noonan, who's still majorly bummed out four years after his wife Jo's unexpected death. Dude's got serious writer's block and can't even look at his computer without freaking. It's a deep dive into grief, ghosts, and getting past your past.</p></strong>
