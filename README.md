clear# The point of each website

### Learning HTML First Time
This was me just learning and plotting down all that I learned. it's very much random and it isn't supposed to look good.

### 1st Website (HTML ONLY) 
As the title says, it's an HTML only site inspired by websites from the 90's. CSS wasn't widespread until the early 2000's so.. yeah. it was pretty fun to do and it was also interesting to see what sorts of tricks people did when creating something different.
